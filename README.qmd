# Replication code for "Do neonates hear what we measure? Assessing neonatal ward soundscapes at the neonates’ ears"

The GitHub repository contains the code to replicate the analysis, figures and tables for the paper titled: "Do neonates hear what we measure? Assessing neonatal ward soundscapes at the neonates’ ears".

The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in NTU research\
data repository DR-NTU (Data) at <https://doi.org/10.21979/N9/8GHNGX>

The subheadings in this repository follows the headings in the paper (after the \[Data Loading\] section) for consistency.

The following figures are produced by this replication code:
